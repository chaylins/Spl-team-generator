# Spl-team-generator

## Description

A bot that initially crawls the top players in the Modern leaderboard, and scrapes the games they played and stores performance of different team compositions

## Requirements

This was developed against a postgres database, so you will need to have an instance of it stored locally. You can execute the scripts in the Database folder to setup the initial database schema that is required. You can run all the scripts inside the Database folder to create all the DB objects needed

## Installation

Installation is straight forward, you just need to create your own virtual environment, use pip to install using the requirements.txt file and all dependencies should be good.
